      <h1>A Withering Bloom</h1>
    <h3>By Dylan Umino		</h3>
				
<p>
It’s a sucky day. Wind whistled through the trees as I walked down the gravel path down by the lake. I liked hanging out there when I was younger. I stared at the rocks beneath my bare feet. Some were sharp and pointy and stabbed into my feet, tiny dots of blood painting on the path as I walked. It doesn’t matter. Not anymore. 

I had a really great friend. Their name was Anthony, and they were smart. They were going to escape this hell hole and get out. He could’ve gone to a good college with a good major, and risen up out of here. But now it’s far too late for that. It’s been three months, and the pain still doesn’t go away. 

Anthony wanted to change this town. Anthony was filled with hope and compassion for our entire world, and this godforsaken town just didn’t care. Instead of looking out for themselves, they just kept on moving, always speaking their mind to everyone, regardless of how the people responded. It was inspiring and stupid, he shouldn’t have talked about these things. Not here.

Still they would just go out every day and talk about climate change. I started reading about the climate and it’s so much. This town never really believed in such things. It wasn’t meant for us. We’re just an isolated little town who never learned or cared about climate change. I reached the edge of the lake and sat down. On the lake striders hopped and skipped on the water. Ugly insects. The lake's surface was murky and obscured, a greenish brown hue from being choked with mud and algae. Anthony often talked about this lake. It was a cornerstone in the childhood of every person in this town. He mentioned algal blooms, where human pollution would be fed on by algae until the algae consumed the entire ecosystem, killing itself with its own gluttony, leaving only a desolate wasteland. 

I stepped into the lake, soaking my legs, and ripped a piece of algae out of the lake. I threw it onto the bank. Still the water was green and hidden. I ripped out another piece, and then another. It’s futile. A voice whispered in my head to stop. He won’t come back. I stepped back out of the lake, dripping green over the rocks. I screamed. With rage and agony and sadness. All of the feelings I have bottled up for the last three months just came out, and when I woke from my stupor my throat was coarse and scratchy.  

When we were children, all Anthony would ever talk about was getting out of here. He wanted to escape this tiny town. It was isolated from the rest of the world, trapped in its own bubble, too small for the government to really care, and too stuck in its own ways to ever ask for help. As children everyone wanted to leave, to aspire to great things, to leave this cursed bubble. I really thought Anthony could. But they stayed. 

This was never really a place for someone like Anthony. Too small, in size and in mind for what Anthony was. I was his best friend, and even I couldn’t understand him-. Them. Even I couldn’t understand them sometimes. Still. They stayed and they tried to make this place better. Tried to get us to act. They wanted to change our dreams from escaping this town called hell to improving it. We rely on coal and oil too much. We kill too many animals. Our farming practices leave behind barren earth. I would give so much to hear another incessant nag. 

By the time I stood back up, the sun was setting. The beautiful orange globe was melding with the horizon and casting beautiful gradients across the sky. Minutes pass and it sinks lower and lower. In the end, the sun falls completely underneath and darkness covers everything. I know it’s crazy, but I read that climate change makes our days shorter, isn’t that something.

I pull a lighter from my pocket. I took out a candle too. Anthony never really got a grave. The people were too ashamed, and so instead the lake was just ignored. I lit the candle and held it high. Anthony would probably hate this. They would say that I’m contributing carbon to the atmosphere right now, and I should be doing something more productive. But today I want to be a little selfish. Lights flickered on, one by one, picturesquely, as dark silhouettes were illuminated, all around the lake.  

We held a silent vigil for Anthony for the rest of the night. When dawn came, everyone had stayed. I recognized them. Their eyes were red and watery, from grown men to tiny children. They had all loved and hated Anthony. They were a shining beacon in a pile of mud, and everyone praised them and lowered their gazes in resentment that such a person would stay. 

But now they were all here. Just like me, far too late. I think their tears are fake and their hate is irredeemable. But that's because Anthony was my friend and I loved them. Now that they are gone, the scenic environment that this town was surrounded by is dark. But maybe Anthony did change them, planted a beautiful bloom in the middle of this withering town, that we’ll act on climate change, even if it cost Anthony everything.
